# Disaster_Recovery
Multi-Region Disaster Recovery Setup on GCP
ðŸ“Œ Objective
To design and implement a multi-region disaster recovery solution using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, where infrastructure is deployed across two GCP regions. The architecture replicates data, ensures high availability, and implements automated failover. The setup uses Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Cloud Build for CI/CD pipelines to keep both regions synchronized for disaster recovery.
